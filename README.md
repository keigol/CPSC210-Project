# Workout Tracker
This application allows users to manage their **workouts** and see the **progress** they have made. 
People will find this application useful for *staying on top of their fitness.*
I am interested in this project because even though there are apps that are similar to this,
none had the exact functionality that I wished for.
So with this project, I can make something that will be of use to me and others like me.
