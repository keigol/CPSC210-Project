# Workout Tracker
This application allows users to manage their **workouts** and see the **progress** they have made. 
People will find this application useful for *staying on top of their fitness.*
I am interested in this project because even though there are apps that are similar to this,
none had the exact functionality that I wished for.
So with this project, I can make something that will be of use to me and others like me.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create a workout workoutProgram
- As a user, I want to be able to add/delete sessions to a workoutProgram
- As a user, I want to be able to add/delete exercises to a session
- As a user, I want to be able to view my workout workoutProgram
- As a user, I want to be able to view individual workout sessions
- As a user, I want to be able to automatically save my data to a file
- As a user, I want to be able to automatically load my data from a file on startup


#### In the future:
- As a user, I want to see my weight progress
- As a user, I want to be able to start a workout session


###Phase 4: Task 2
A HashMap was used in the class MainScreen. This map has a card as its value, and the cards title as the key.

###Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time I would:
- Refactor the GUI into many more classes to increase cohesion and to follow the single responsibility principle
- Create more methods to increase cohesion and to follow the single responsibility principle
- Create more abstract classes and interfaces to reduce repeated code in the GUI
